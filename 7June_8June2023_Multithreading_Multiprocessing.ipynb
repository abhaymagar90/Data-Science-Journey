        "Multithreading is a programming technique that assigns multiple code segments to a single process. These code segments, also referred to as threads, run concurrently and parallel to each other. These threads share the same memory space within a parent process. This saves system memory, increases computing speed and improves application performance.\n",

You might also be listening to music through a desktop application at the same time. The internet browser and music application represent two different processes, even though they are operating simultaneously. However, the multiple tabs you have open while browsing the internet represent threads of your internet browser, which is the parent process."

        "What is multiprocessing?\n",
        "Multiprocessing refers to a system that has more than two central processing units (CPUs). Every additional CPU added to a system increases its speed, power and memory. This allows users to run multiple processes simultaneously. Each CPU may also function independently, and some CPUs may remain idle if they don't have anything to process. This can improve the reliability of a system because unused CPUs can act as a backup if technical issues arise. There are two primary categories of multiprocessing systems:\n",
